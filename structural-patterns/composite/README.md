# Composite Pattern

The composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

An example of this is a file system. A file system is composed of files and directories. A directory can contain files and other directories. The client can treat a file and a directory as a single object.
To run the example run ```composer udpate``` on builder dir.
then run ```php index.php```
